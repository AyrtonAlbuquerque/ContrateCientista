    The process of searching for cientific and technological innovation always goes through universities, where most of the brilliant minds of our time are and where a great portion of the cutting edge research is done. Despite the excelence in the creation of new solutions, the process of linking a technological demand with a researcher able to meet such demand is often slow, inefficient and bureaucratic, which ends up discouraging the productive world from looking for institutions to form partnerships. To come is rescue of this problem the "Hire a Cientist" was idealized, a platform where the productive sector, through an application, can search for a researcher able the meet its demands is a simple and straight foward way, without the need for third parties.

    To reach this objective, the application utilizes the "CV Lattes" database, a goverment platform the stores the information about brazilian professionals and researchers. The main objective of this project is to integrate this tool with an application capable os providing to a user the possibility of finding a researcher in a especific area of knowledge that is able to meet a technological demand and connect the user directly to this researcher, facilitatig the creation of partnerships and contracts that benefits the user as well as the institution at which the researcher works on.
